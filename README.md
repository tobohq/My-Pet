# 🐶 Description
This is a simple Virtual Pet Simulator where you take care of a pomeranian dog. The dog has four main needs: Hunger, Cleanliness, Sleep, and Fun. You can satisfy these needs by interacting with the dog using drag-and-drop objects, buttons, or by clicking directly on the dog.

# 🔄 Need Decay Timers:
- **Hunger** decreases by 1 every **7.5 seconds**
- **Cleanliness** decreases by 1 every **12 seconds**
- **Energy** decreases by 1 every **13 seconds**
- **Playfulness (Fun)** decreases by 1 every **30 seconds**
  

# 🖱️ Interactions:
- **Click the dog →** Increases Fun by 1 per click

- **Click the Sleep button →** Increases Sleep by 1 every second

- **Drag ham to the dog →** Increases Hunger by 5

- **Drag soap to the dog →** Increases Cleanliness by 5

# 💭 Future Features (That I Might Add)
Originally, I wanted to build a shop system for different food items and dog outfits. But creating custom sprites took a lot of time. I decided to create my own as finding usable sprites online was harder than expected. I didn’t think I could finish everything by the project deadline if I went all-in on those features.

So instead, I settled on a simpler version: a single button that lets you buy one type of food.

I also considered adding multiple pets, but chose to focus on polishing the gameplay for just one dog first. If I had implemented a manager system, I could’ve made:

- A menu for new users to pick their pet

- A shop screen to unlock items or outfits

That’s something I’d like to revisit later!
