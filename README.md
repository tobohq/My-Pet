# Features Potentially Implemented in the Future

Original plan was to create a shop for the food items and new outfits for the dog. Creating the sprites took a long time as looking for sprites on google was difficult. I did not think I would be able to finish within the project due date if I implemented this feature so the next best thing for a shop was having a button to buy one type of food only.  I also did not create new pets because I wanted to focus on implementing all the features on one pet before I did another one.
